This is a lightweight but efficient line calculator that calculates lines of `C`, `Assembly`, and `Makefile` code. It's invented when I am developing my OS (In order to count lines of code). I use it to count the lines of `linux-0.11`. There are 11869 lines of code in linux 0.11!! Well. This line calculator is written in `Shell`, so it will be running properly on every UNIX-like systems as long as the system has `find` and `wc`.

## Installing

Download it from GitHub. Then move it to the directory that you want to calculate lines. At last type the command to get surprise.

> ./lines
